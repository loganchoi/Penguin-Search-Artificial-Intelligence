# üêß Penguin Game AI Optimization

## Overview

This project involves the development and enhancement of a penguin game using artificial intelligence algorithms to achieve an optimized winning state through continuous iteration and testing. In the game, the penguin is tasked with collecting food and avoiding hazards to secure a victory. Various algorithms, including BFS, DFS, GREEDY Best First Search, and A-Star, were implemented to find winning states, and their performance was thoroughly studied, with a focus on speed optimization.

## Features

- **Algorithmic Approaches:**
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - GREEDY Best First Search
  - A-Star

- **Game Mechanics:**
  - Penguin navigation to collect üç£ food while avoiding hazards.

- **Optimization:**
  - Continuous iteration and testing to enhance the game's AI for achieving optimized winning states.

## Performance Evaluation

- **Speed Analysis:**
  - Evaluate the speed of each algorithm in finding winning states to determine their efficiency.
